#Kotlin - Android Example

This is an example Android project made with Kotlin which also utilizes Dagger and Retrofit.

## Developing
Add your own api key to the project from [The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) since I didn't
add mine to git.

If you want to see this same example without dagger, please refer to this
[commit](https://github.com/AGS-/KotlinExample/tree/3adb912cd6485b7a4eb2123dcd3ff0dfcb38b009).
